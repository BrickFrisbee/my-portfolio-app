## Description
My personal portfolio website, crafted using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, showcases highlights from my resume and a curated list of my projects, each linked directly to its GitHub repository. I've integrated getform.io for efficient email collection in the contact section and employed React smooth scroll to elevate the website's user experience. The site is responsive, adapting to various window sizes. When the window is minimized, a hamburger menu facilitates smooth navigation. Additionally, as the window expands beyond half the screen width, four collapsible buttons appear, offering direct links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and resume.

## Execution
Before running the project through localhost, be sure to install the node packet manager using `npm install`. 

To run the project locally, enter `npm start` in the project directory. Your browser will then open the website at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Workflow

The site is made up of five sections: "Home", "About", "Skills", "Projects", and "Contact." You may choose to scroll or use the hamburger menu for navigation. Four collapsable buttons redirect the user to my LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and resume.  

##### Home
The "Home" section provides an introduction and brief description of myself. Their is a button to navigate to my projects. 

##### About
The "About" section provides more information about myself.

##### Skills
The "Skills" section lists eight of the favorite technologies that I have worked with.

##### Projects
The "Projects" section lists six of my favorite projects, and provides a button to redirect the user to their github repositories.

##### Contact
The "Contact" section provides a way for users to contact me through getform.io. It also includes my personal email.
